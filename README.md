# Breath Easy - Air Quality Monitoring System

## Overview
Breath Easy is a real-time air quality monitoring system designed to detect and alert users about harmful air pollutants. Using sensors and IoT technology, the system continuously measures air quality parameters and provides real-time data visualization on a web interface. The goal of this project is to promote awareness about air pollution and help individuals take necessary precautions.

## Features
- **Real-time air quality monitoring**: Continuously measures pollutant levels and updates data.
- **Web-based dashboard**: Displays air quality index (AQI) and pollutant concentrations.
- **Alert system**: Notifies users when pollution levels exceed safe limits.
- **User-friendly interface**: Simple and interactive visualization for easy understanding.
- **Portable and scalable**: Can be deployed in multiple locations.

## Components Required
- ESP32 (or similar microcontroller with Wi-Fi capability)
- MQ-135 gas sensor (for detecting air pollutants)
- DHT11/DHT22 (for temperature and humidity monitoring)
- OLED display (optional, for local display of readings)
- Jumper wires and breadboard

## How It Works
1. The air quality sensors collect real-time data on pollutants, temperature, and humidity.
2. The ESP32 processes the sensor data and transmits it to the web dashboard.
3. The web application displays the air quality index (AQI) and pollutant levels in an easy-to-understand format.
4. If pollution levels exceed a predefined threshold, users receive alerts.

## Usage
- Deploy the system in areas where air quality monitoring is needed.
- Access real-time data via the web dashboard.
- Take necessary actions based on air quality readings and alerts.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with a mobile application for instant notifications.
- AI-based prediction models for air pollution trends.
- Support for additional sensors to measure more pollutants.

This project is a step towards creating awareness and ensuring a healthier environment. üåçüí®
